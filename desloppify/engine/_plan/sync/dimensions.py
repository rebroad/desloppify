"""Sync subjective dimensions into the plan queue.

Two independent sync functions:

- **sync_unscored_dimensions** — append never-scored (placeholder) dimensions
  to the *back* of the queue unconditionally.
- **sync_stale_dimensions** — append stale (previously-scored) dimensions to
  the *back* of the queue when no objective items remain, and evict them
  again when objective backlog returns.

Invariant: new items are always appended — sync never reorders existing queue.
